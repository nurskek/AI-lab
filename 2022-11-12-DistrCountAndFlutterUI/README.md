## DistirbutedCounter

Main goal: in general, main idea is to try the logic of saving queries in one collection and connect and retrieve those incoming queries with the main functioning document.

Task seems to take substantial amount of time. Estimated time to spend and deploy successfully: several days (including learning how to migrate js or other language to dart). Of course, in focused mode.
